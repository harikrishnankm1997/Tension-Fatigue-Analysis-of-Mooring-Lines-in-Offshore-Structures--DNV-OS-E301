# Tension-Fatigue-Analysis-of-Mooring-Lines-in-Offshore-Structures--DNV-OS-E301
main project
Promor is a Singapore based company it is a independent provider of services to the offshore oil and gas industry they successfully providing complete engineering services for both FPSO and FSO the services includes process studies, utility systems and hull structures riser balconies subsea systems and complete mooring systems. 

The company need to measure the annual fatigue damage of mooring line systems inoder to find the breaking point of the mooring line the system follows \textbf{DNV-OS-E301} standard to find fatigue life of the line. 

The computation is very complex and repetitive so it takes lots of time to complete it the company approach to me to develop an software program that need to capable of computing line annual fatigue caused by various load conditions and sea states . 

This application enables the user to compute annual fatigue damage caused from sensor output files data extraction and preprocessing computation and conclusion and report generation is done by the application. This enable time required structuring of sensor output file data is reduced provide better understanding of computation result annual fatigue damage of line for the user
